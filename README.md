In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
