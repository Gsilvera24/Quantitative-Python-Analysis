Financial Analysis using Python
======

Python script that analyzes financial records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Specificially, the financial records is a .csv file containing budget data over several years.

Procedure & Screenshots
======

The following is a screenshot of my notebook file rendered in VS Code where I have imported the Pandas and Path libraries. 
After, I simply pointed my path variable to a CSV file named "budget_data" and loaded the dataframe using the .read_csv function.
